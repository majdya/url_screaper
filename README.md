Code for the 2 interview questions (what I mange to recall).
The src directory include 2 programs, main.js & cache.js
1. main.js is the title fetcher function is calls for some other functions, splitted for readability, in the main.js you also have a variable for the url that you want to get titles from.
2. the cache.js contain the memo function that store the result of a heavy task and cache this data.  
---------------------------
to run the code, run "npm install" in the root dir, and run the script with 
1. "npm run main"       // this will run the title/url fetcher
2. "npm run cache.js"   // this will run the cache .js file
